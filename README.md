# Hi, I'm Sasikumar 👋
**Java Backend Developer** · building reliable, testable, and well-documented microservices.

🔭 I’m currently looking for a Java backend role (Spring Boot / Spring Cloud / REST / SQL).
🌱 Learning: distributed systems, observability, Kafka, Kubernetes.
💬 Ask me about: clean architecture, RESTful API design, test automation.

## Featured projects
- **inventory-service** — Spring Boot microservice with REST API, JPA, PostgreSQL, Docker, and GitHub Actions CI.  
- **auth-server** — OAuth2 / JWT auth server demo with token refresh and unit/integration tests.  
- **job-scraper** — small batch app that scrapes jobs and stores them into DB (shows scheduling + Docker).

*(Pin these repos to your profile so they show up here.)*
